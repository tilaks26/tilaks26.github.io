CSCI-B 649 - Topics in Systems - Advanced Science Gateway Architectures (Spring 2017)

During my time in the course, I have worked on 2 main problems - 

- Load Balancing the PHP Laravel Portal
- Data Management - Database Versioning

My contributions in each of the above problems can be found on my blogs -

- [CI CD Mechanism for the Laravel Portal](https://tilaks26.github.io/journal/Assignment1&2.html)
- [Two Phase Commit Mechanism](https://tilaks26.github.io/journal/Assignment3.html)
- [Introduction to Database Versioning and the Possible Solutions](https://tilaks26.github.io/journal/Assignment4.html)
- [Evaluation of the Solutions for Database Versioning](https://tilaks26.github.io/journal/Assignment5.html)

I have also participated in a few dev-list deiscussions which can be found at - [Discussions](https://tilaks26.github.io/journal/My-Airavata-Dev-List-Discussions.html)

For my Summer as a GSoC Developer, I would like to concentrate more on the Database Versioning tools discussed in my blog and come up with a solution that is Apache Airavata specific. My GSoC proposal can be found on - [GSoC Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GgfPZrv8jA0e-xAyNCYSIhYyofOwjbaNGkFlAhejz_Q/edit?usp=sharing)
